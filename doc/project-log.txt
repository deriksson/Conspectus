Debian has start-/stop scripts in /etc/init.d/ which are documented in the Debian Policy Manual. An example is available in /etc/init.d/skeleton. These scripts use start−stop−daemon to start and stop a background process. So to configure a start/stop script for a Java application, copy the skeleton f.e. to /etc/init.d/myserver and customize the settings.

Then update-rc.d is executed to update the scripts for the run levels:

update-rc.d myserver defaults
If the application needs additional arguments (like log4j.configuration) I recommend to created a little wrapper script like bin/myserver so you don’t need to keep this configuration in the init.d script:

#!/bin/sh

cd $(dirname $0)/../
exec java -Dlog4j.configuration=file:./conf/log4j.properties -jar bin/felix.jar
The exec here is important, it makes the started java process replace the script process, so that a) the process id doesn’t change and b) we don’t get an additional process because of the script.

nohup java -jar $PATH_TO_JAR /tmp 2>> /dev/null >> /dev/null &
                        echo $! > $PID_PATH_NAME
