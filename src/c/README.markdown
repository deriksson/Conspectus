# ANSI C UDP Client
This directory contains the source code for a UDP client for sending queries to the Conspectus server. 
The client code is written in ANSI C (C99 and C11) and might be used instead of the Java client for lightening fast 
execution. The client program should typically be installed in the `/usr/local/bin` directory.

## Installation

  `make`  
  `sudo make install`

## Usage
 
  `query <host name> <port> <query>`
